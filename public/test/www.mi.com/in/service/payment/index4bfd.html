<li>Refund shall be conditional and shall be with recourse available to Xiaomi in case of any misuse by Buyer.</li>
<li>Refund shall be subject to Buyer complying with the Terms of Use.</li>
<li>Xiaomi reserves the right to impose limits on the number of Transactions or Transaction Price which Xiaomi may receive from on an individual valid credit/debit/ cash card / valid bank account/ and such other infrastructure or any other financial instrument directly or indirectly through payment aggregator or through any such facility authorized by Reserve Bank of India to provide enabling support facility for collection and remittance of payment or by an individual Buyer during any time period, and reserves the right to refuse to process Transactions exceeding such limit.</li>
