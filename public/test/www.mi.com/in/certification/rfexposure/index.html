This mobile phone model 2014818 has been designed to comply with applicable safety requirements for exposure of radio waves.
 <br><br>The radio wave exposure guidelines employ a measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) which refers to the rate at which the body absorbs RF energy. SAR value as the basic restrictions is specified in Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC, which is 2W/kg in countries that set the limit averaged over 10 gram of tissue; and in the IEEE Std C95.1-2005, which is 1.6 W/kg in counties that set the limit averaged over 1 gram of tissue.
 <br><br>During SAR testing, this device was set to transmit at its highest certified power levels in all tested frequency bands, and placed in positions that simulate RF exposure in usage against the head with no separation, and near the body with the separation not exceeding 25 mm.
 <br><br>To make sure the mobile phone working on a lower RF exposure status, use a hands-free option, such as Bluetooth headphone, supplied headphones, or other similar accessory. Use of other accessories which contain metal parts may not ensure compliance with RF exposure guidelines.
 <br><br>Although this device has been tested to determine SAR in each band of operation, not all bands are available in all areas. Bands are dependent on your service provider’s wireless and roaming networks.
 <br><br>The highest SAR values are as follows:<br>Model 2014818<br>1.6 W/kg (over 1 g) SAR Limit<br>Head: 0.999 W/kg<br>Body:0.982 W/kg   (Max distance 15mm)<br>

SAR value as the basic restrictions is specified in Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC, which is 2W/kg in countries that set the limit averaged over 10 gram of tissue; and in the IEEE Std C95.1-2005, which is 1.6 W/kg in counties that set the limit averaged over 1 gram of tissue.
 <br><br>During SAR testing, this device was set to transmit at its highest certified power levels in all tested frequency bands, and placed in positions that simulate RF exposure in usage against the head with no separation, and near the body with the separation not exceeding 25 mm.
 <br><br>To make sure the mobile phone working on a lower RF exposure status, use a hands-free option, such as Bluetooth headphone, supplied headphones, or other similar accessory. Use of other accessories which contain metal parts may not ensure compliance with RF exposure guidelines.
 <br><br>Although this device has been tested to determine SAR in each band of operation, not all bands are available in all areas. Bands are dependent on your service provider’s wireless and roaming networks.
 <br><br>The highest SAR values are as follows:<br>Model M1903F11I<br>1.6 W/kg (over 1 g) SAR Limit<br>Head: 1.030 W/kg<br>Body: 0.720 W/kg       (distance 15 mm)<br></div>
